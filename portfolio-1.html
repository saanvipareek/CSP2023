    <center><h1>  The picture above is the 4 different houses you could get, based off of the user's answers/input. How this game works is that the User is asked a series of questions, and based off of their answers, they are drawn one of these 4 houses! Though it seems simple, the problem solving process was time consuming and making minor changes to perfect the houses definetly took time. We were able to display different colors and shapes via the house drawings, and use loops for deciding what house to present to the user.</h1>

    <center><h1>  The second project I worked on was called "Cow Clicker." The way it worked was that, first, the user was asked what them they would like (the picture above shows the different game options). Based off of their input, they would get to play the game of clicking on the moving cow that moo's everytime it clicks on. There was a timer and glass of milk reward if you got to 15 clicks in 20 seconds! If not - you would get a turd emoji. </h1>
