    <center><h1>  The picture above is the 4 different houses you could get, based off of the user's answers/input. How this game works is that the User is asked a series of questions, and based off of their answers, they are drawn one of these 4 houses! Though it seems simple, the problem solving process was time consuming and making minor changes to perfect the houses definetly took time. We were able to display different colors and shapes via the house drawings, and use loops for deciding what house to present to the user.</h1>
